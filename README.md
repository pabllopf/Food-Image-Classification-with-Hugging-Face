# Food-Image-Classification-with-Hugging-Face
Classify food images using Hugging Face models, automatically recognizing and categorizing food items.

# Description: 
Use Hugging Face models to automatically identify and categorize food items in user-uploaded photos on a social media platform, detecting foods most likely to be in the photos. This will keep the platform's content organized and make personalized recommendations better, boosting user engagement.

# Project Instructions
The social media company hired you to help them perform image classification to identify food categories. A sample image has been provided in the Food Pictures directory. You start by finding answers to the following questions:

What model would you use for this image classification task? Search for a Hugging Face model suitable for the task and use it to get the probabilities of different food categories corresponding to the sample image provided. Store the result in a list of dictionaries named class_scores, containing the food categories and their probability.

Classify the sample food image: identify the label of the food category with the highest probability for the uploaded image. Store the result as a string named highest_probability_class.

# Food Image Classification with Hugging Face

A popular social media platform dedicated to food enthusiasts wants to improve user engagement by adding advanced image recognition features. As a machine learning engineer, you are tasked with developing a food image classification system using Hugging Face's state-of-the-art models. This system will automatically identify and categorize food items in user-uploaded photos, allowing for better content organization and personalized food content recommendations.

Your responsibility is to develop a robust food category image classification system using pre-trained models from Hugging Face.

The goal is to enhance user interaction by providing accurate food classification, enabling users to easily find and engage with content related to their favorite foods, and improving the overall experience on the platform.

In this dynamic project, we leverage the power of PyTorch and transformers, utilizing an open-source model from Hugging Face as the backbone of our solution.
